# G2E Filametrix Lever Switch Mod
This is a modification of the original G2E Filametrix mod to incorporate the use of switches with levers instead of the typical bearing ball and switch. Thank silverback_attack for all his hard work to make this mod easier.

Why you ask? The tolerance stack on the bearing ball design leads to chances of improper actuation and also rolls the ball across the switch button, which could lead to wear and more chance of it not actuating. This uses the lever principal to increase the amount of overtravel allowed. It also removes the chance of wear on the switch button as the contact is stationary. Lastly, it doesn't require a bearing ball that you may not have. It does require a switch you might not have though, the Omron D2F-L3-D3 simulated roller levered switch.
